# Nonlinear optics acronyms and abbreviations

A comprehensive list of nonlinear optics acronyms and abbreviations. Feel free to :star: it!

## Contributing 📝

Feel free to:

* add any NLO-related abbreviation,
* add the definition alone,
* add an issue.

The description should be a __brief and concise one/few-liner__ rather than explain the whole subject.
The purpose is to quickly find the meaniong of abbreviation, translation to polish, and the given definition helps to undersdtand if it matches the context.
__Abbreviations should be in alphabetical order.__
